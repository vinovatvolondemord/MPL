#Vacation Responder
  Create a program that will act as an automated multilingual out-of-office responder for GMail.The program should connect to selected GMail mailbox, retrieve unread messages from the Inbox (or some test  folder,  you  can  make  this  configurable),  try  to detect  message  language  (at  least English and German should be supported, English is a last-resort) and send reply using the predefined text template for the language detected (read from a file e.g. en.txt). You should use the GMail APIto interact with a mailbox. You can rely on history to pick up changes from previous run instead of parsing the whole folder. You can mark messages already processed with a label or other means in order to send a response only one per input mailmessage.You are free to choose any tools and methods of language detection you like â€”online translators, local libraries, etc.
